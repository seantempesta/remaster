# Video Enhancement Experiment Platform

## What This Is
An experimentation platform for improving video quality using ML models. The primary use case is reducing compression artifacts in existing video libraries (e.g., BluRay rips) at native resolution.

## Goals
- Denoise/enhance 1080p video content using learned models
- Process full episodes in reasonable time on consumer hardware (RTX 3060 6GB)
- Compare different approaches: per-frame denoisers, temporal fusion, diffusion models
- Eventually train a custom fast model via distillation

## Architecture
- **Local inference** runs on Windows with conda env `upscale` (Python 3.10, PyTorch 2.5.1+cu121)
- **Cloud training** uses [Modal](https://modal.com) for GPU compute — CLI authenticated, account with billing attached
- **Streaming pipeline** reads video -> processes frames -> writes video (no intermediate files)
- All scripts are standalone Python — no framework dependencies beyond PyTorch

## Key Constraints
- 6GB VRAM — must use fp16, tiling, or half-res tricks to fit
- Dependencies get overwritten easily — always install PyTorch CUDA from `--index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121` LAST or with `--no-deps`
- Prefer patching code for modern PyTorch over pinning old dependencies
- xformers is unreliable on Windows — use native `F.scaled_dot_product_attention` instead

## Directory Structure
- `lib/` — shared importable code: paths, ffmpeg utils, metrics, NAFNet architecture
- `pipelines/` — production streaming denoisers (SCUNet batch, NAFNet, episode)
- `experiments/` — one-off experiments and older approaches
- `training/` — NAFNet distillation training scripts
- `cloud/` — Modal remote GPU execution scripts
- `bench/` — benchmarking and quality comparison
- `tools/` — small utilities (clip extraction, probing, MP4 repair)
- `docs/` — documentation (setup, architecture, experiment log, approach comparison)

## Key Scripts
- `pipelines/denoise_batch.py` — main pipeline: batched SCUNet with threaded IO
- `pipelines/denoise_nafnet.py` — NAFNet pipeline (for distilled model)
- `pipelines/denoise_episode.py` — original episode denoiser (simpler, single-frame)
- `training/train_nafnet.py` — NAFNet distillation training loop
- `bench/compare.py` — PSNR/SSIM metrics and side-by-side comparison
- `bench/bench_nafnet.py` — NAFNet vs SCUNet benchmark

## Reference Code Submodules (`reference-code/`)
- `SCUNet/` — Swin-Conv-UNet denoiser (current best approach, patched: thop try/except)
- `RAFT/` — optical flow estimation
- `NAFNet/` — NAFNet architecture reference (pretrained weights)
- `Video-Depth-Anything/` — temporally consistent depth maps (patched: xformers→SDPA)
- `FlashVSR/`, `FlashVSR-Pro/`, `BasicVSR_PlusPlus/` — video SR references
- `KAIR/` — image restoration toolkit reference

## Data Directory
`data/` contains video clips, extracted frames, model outputs. Git-ignored due to size.

## Modal Development Guidelines

### Style & Conventions
- Always `import modal` and use qualified names: `modal.App()`, `modal.Image.debian_slim()`, etc.
- Name Apps, Volumes, and Secrets with **kebab-case**
- Modal evolves quickly — never use deprecated features; `modal run` prints deprecation warnings
- Dependencies belong in per-Function `Image` definitions, not global requirements files
- Put `import` statements for heavy deps **inside** the Function body (global scope must run everywhere)

### Core Concepts
- **App** — group of Functions/Classes deployed together
- **Function** — basic unit of serverless execution, each runs in its own container with its own Image
- **Cls** — stateful class with `@modal.enter()` / `@modal.exit()` lifecycle hooks
- **Image** — container image (`modal.Image.debian_slim().pip_install(...)`)
- **Volume** — distributed filesystem; **Secret** — credentials; **Dict** / **Queue** — distributed data structures
- **Sandbox** — run arbitrary code securely at runtime

### Function Configuration
```python
@app.function(
    image=modal.Image.debian_slim(python_version="3.12").pip_install("torch"),
    gpu="A10G",        # or "H100", "A100:2", ["H100", "A100", "any"]
    memory=4096,
    cpu=2,
)
def my_func():
    ...
```

### Invocation Patterns
- `fn.remote()` — run in cloud container (most common)
- `fn.local()` — run in caller's context
- `fn.map(inputs)` — parallel map
- `fn.spawn()` — fire-and-forget (terminated when App exits)

### Web Endpoints
```python
@app.function()
@modal.fastapi_endpoint()
def endpoint():
    return {"status": "ok"}
```

### Scheduling
```python
@app.function(schedule=modal.Period(minutes=5))
# or: schedule=modal.Cron("0 9 * * *")
```

### CLI Commands
- `modal run path/to/app.py` — run during development
- `modal serve path/to/app.py` — serve web endpoints with hot-reload
- `modal deploy path/to/app.py` — deploy to production
- `modal app logs <app_name>` — stream logs
- `modal app list`, `modal volume list`, `modal secret list`, etc. — resource management
